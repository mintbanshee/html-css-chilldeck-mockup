## 💡 Project Overview

This is a **single-page HTML & CSS mockup** created during **Week 1** of my Web & App Development program. The layout and assets were provided as part of the assignment, and I was encouraged to customize it with my own theme, colors, and written content.

I designed the page around a fictional web developer persona named **Chilldeck** — a mysterious, ninja-like coder who glides through projects with precision and flair. 🌌⚔️
